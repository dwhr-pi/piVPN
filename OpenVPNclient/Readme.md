# Setting Up OpenVPN Client on Raspberry Piâ€¦
1, 2
Using your Raspberry Pi as an OpenVPN client allows you to securely connect to a VPN server. 
Below are the steps to configure it.

## 1. Install OpenVPN

Start by installing the OpenVPN package on your Raspberry Pi:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openvpn -y
```

## 2. Transfer Configuration Files

Obtain the .ovpn configuration file from your VPN provider or server. 
Transfer it to your Raspberry Pi using a method like SCP, USB, or email.

Move the file to the OpenVPN directory:

```
sudo mv /path/to/your-config-file.ovpn /etc/openvpn/
```

## 3. Configure Authentication (Optional)

If your VPN requires a username and password, create a file to store these credentials:

```
sudo nano /etc/openvpn/auth.txt
```

Add the following lines:

```
your-username
your-password
```
Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, and Enter). 
Update the .ovpn file to use this credentials file:

```
auth-user-pass /etc/openvpn/auth.txt
```

## 4. Start OpenVPN Client

Run the following command to start the VPN connection:

```
sudo openvpn /etc/openvpn/your-config-file.ovpn
```

You will see logs indicating the connection status.

## 5. Enable Auto-Connect at Boot

To ensure the VPN connects automatically on boot, rename your '.ovpn' file to match this format:

```
sudo mv /etc/openvpn/your-config-file.ovpn /etc/openvpn/client.conf
```

Enable the OpenVPN service:

```
sudo systemctl enable openvpn@client
sudo systemctl start openvpn@client
```

## 6. Verify Connection

Check your public IP address to confirm you're connected to the VPN:
```
curl ifconfig.me
```

## Tips

Ensure your '.ovpn' file is correctly configured for your VPN server.

Use sudo systemctl status openvpn@client to troubleshoot connection issues.

For enhanced security, avoid storing plain-text credentials unless necessary.

This setup ensures a secure and reliable VPN connection on your Raspberry Pi
